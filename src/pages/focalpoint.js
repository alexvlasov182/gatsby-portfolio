            I worked in a cross-functional team. As the main UX/UI designer, I
            was involved in all phases of the project, from mapping out the
            problem to delivering final designs.

          </h3>
          <p>
            This CRM systemâ€™s taught me to work with large databases. We have
            automated the process of analyzing data on purchases of giant
            companies. The project was successfully presented to customers.
