          <p>
            Create an easy-to-use and multifunctional to-do application. Make it
            easy not only to manage personal tasks, but also to manage big
            projects, create collections and share it with a team.

          <p>
            I worked in a cross-functional team. With one another designer on
            this project we were involved in all phases of the project, from
            mapping out the problem to delivering final designs

            What I have learned from this project?
          </h3>
          <p>
            For complex UX problems research is a must. I couldnâ€™t have designed
            a product users love without the help of people who will actually
            use it. The user interviews revealed unexpected information.
