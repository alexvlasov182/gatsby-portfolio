            Create an easy-to-use and multifunctional to-do application. Make it
            easy not only to manage personal tasks, but also to manage big
            projects, create collections and share it with a team.

            I worked in a cross-functional team. With one another designer on
            this project we were involved in all phases of the project, from

            For complex UX problems research is a must. I couldnâ€™t have designed
            a product users love without the help of people who will actually
            use it. The user interviews revealed unexpected information.
